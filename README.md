# Description

Very basic starter structure for express / typescript projects. Contains express, ejs and the respective type definitions.

# Local build

1. Install dependencies (nodemon and typescript should already have been installed globally): `npm install`
2. Compile `.ts` files (edit compile.txt to add more files and directories) to `./src/build`: `npm run compile`
3. Start the server: `npm start`
